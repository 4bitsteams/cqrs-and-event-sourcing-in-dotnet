# CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET
This is the repository for the CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET training class. It contains the code needed to follow along in the class.   

Feel free to submit issues if you have any suggestions for improvements to the code or training class.

The code in the class is influenced by the code and tutorial found at https://cqrs.nu, a site that I co-authored together with my awesome colleagues.
